In this article I will be exploring the effect of maths anxiety on students including, how maths anxiety impacts mathematical achievement, the effect of cognitive functions on math anxiety and the impact of parental math anxiety on children.

<p class="ex2">
Maths anxiety is characterised by a feeling of fear, tension or apprehension regarding mathematics and math-related activities. Math anxiety and students’ academic performance go hand in hand. Students combating maths anxiety can find their ability to perform well be hindered; this can lead to low test scores and lessened performance on assignments.

How math anxiety impacts mathematical achievement 

Math anxiety may lead to decreased performance on maths tasks and assessments(Jarise Kaskens a b, Eliane Segers b, Sui Lin Goei a c, Johannes E.H. van Luit d, Ludo Verhoeven,2020)( Febe Demedts Bert Reynvoet Delphine Sasanguie Fien Depaepe,November 2022.). It may be difficult for the pupils to perform effectively due to their heightened tension and anxiety, which makes it challenging for these individuals to demonstrate their true mathematical abilities. Math anxiety can also hinder effective problem-solving skills. Students may to struggle to think critically and apply the mathematical concepts that they have learnt as their anxiety will be interfering. Students who struggle with math anxiety may start to avoid math related activities and assignments all together. This pattern of avoidance could limit their exposure to mathematical concepts and hinder their mathematical development in turn limiting their mathematical achievement. Math anxiety can create a negative cycle where fear and avoidance hinder the learning process. This is because, when students get anxious about mathematics, they could be less likely to participate in meaningful learning experiences and may not fully grasp mathematical concepts. Studies have shown that math anxiety generally correlates with lessened self-confidence and a decrease in self-esteem, lower levels of confidence can contribute to students underperforming, however some studies show that maths anxiety can cause students to put in more effort into understanding mathematical concepts. Persistent maths anxiety can have long term effects on pupils educational and career choices. These pupils may avoid going into fields or professions which require a strong mathematical foundation, which could limit their career options/ academic achievements.

The effect of cognitive functions on maths anxiety

Cognitive functions can play a significant role on math anxiety, which could be a negative reaction to mathematics (M. Josie Justicia-Galiano, M. Eva Martin-Puga, Rocio Linares and Santiago Pelegrina,2017). The main cognitive function that is affected is the working memory capacity. Our working memory has a limited capacity so it can only hold information for a short period of time. Therefore, individuals that have math anxiety may have a lower working memory capacity, so they may struggle to hold and manipulate information. This can lead to difficulties in the understanding and solving complex math problems. This all according to the processing efficiency theory, which states that experiencing math anxiety and the worrying thoughts following it could dimmish the ability to store and process information effectively. Cognitive functions can also influence attitudes and beliefs about someone’s ability to succeed in maths. This is because cognitive functions can influence students’ performance through drive factors. Students afflicted with math anxiety often steer clear of mathematical tasks, exhibit reduced determination during math related challenges such as problem solving, and they consistently maintain lower expectations regarding their own mathematical performance. However, in certain situations math anxiety may have a positive effect with students that experience this anxiety, the students may counterbalance their performance by putting in additional effort.
  
The impact of parental math anxiety on children    

Parents usually serve as role models for their kids and if a parent shows an unfavourable attitude towards math this might affect the child’s impression of the subject and contribute to the child’s development of maths anxiety(Erin A. Maloney, Gerardo Ramirez, Elizabeth A. Gunderson, Susan C. Levine, Sian L. Beilock,2015). The home learning environment is also a very important factor, because if the child is in a home environment where math is viewed as a stressful subject this can harbour anxiety and stress in the child. Which may lead to the child’s reluctance to perform in math related activities. Parental involvement is a significant factor, as parents that have maths anxiety could be less likely to engage or help their children in their maths education or homework. But on the other hand, these same parents could be more active in helping their children find a tutor or someone to help them. Parents that harbour maths anxiety may unintentionally talk about theirs fears in maths to their children. This can be interpreted as a lack of encouragement, which could potentially impact the child’s motivation and confidence in mathematics. Parents that feel anxious about math may struggle to provide support with math homework or assignments. The inability of assisting with homework can leave the child feeling like they have no means of support, and this may increase their anxiety about maths. Expectations of the parents is also a significant factor as parents that have maths anxiety may mistakenly and unknowingly expect less from their child’s performance. This can show discouragement from parents and in turn lead the child to increased anxiety and significantly reduced academic performance. Talking about the impact of parental mathematical anxiety promotes an optimistic attitude, and to encourage parents to engage in their children’s learning.
